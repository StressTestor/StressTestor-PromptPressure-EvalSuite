- ✅ Pluggable adapter framework preparation (Groq, OpenAI, Mock adapters)

### v1.4
- ✅ Full modular adapter architecture deployed
- ✅ Expanded adapter system for easy backend swaps
- ✅ Robust schema validation

### v1.5 (Current Stable)
- ✅ LM Studio Adapter for local model integration
- ✅ Dataset validator tool (detecting duplicates and errors)
- ✅ Progress bars and enhanced runtime logging
- ✅ Timestamped evaluation outputs to avoid overwrites
- ✅ Runtime registration helper for custom adapters
- ✅ CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Automated visualization and monitoring
- ✅ Dynamic adapter selection
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and retries
- ✅ Development tooling and type hints

### v1.6 (In Progress)
- [ ] Enhanced metrics collection
- [ ] Integration with monitoring services (Prometheus/Grafana)
- [ ] Automated report generation
- [ ] Extended test coverage
- [ ] Performance optimizations
